# Everyday Scripts

A collection of small scripts for personal media workflows.

## Development

Use the dev container to run formatting and test checks. Locally you can
execute:

```bash
./check.sh
```

The `agents-check.sh` helper installs the required tooling and runs the same
checks in a clean environment.
